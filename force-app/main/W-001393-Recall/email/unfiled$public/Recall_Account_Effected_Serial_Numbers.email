        <p>Valued Dealer,</p>

        <p><b>Please find below a list of units affected by the Kawasaki Stop Sale/Stop Use shipped to your dealership.</b></p>

        Stanley Black &amp; Decker retains a high level of safety as a priority for our customers and as such will not jeopardize safety to implement a corrective action before it
        is approved and ready.

        <p>
            Yesterday SBD posted to the dealer portals service advisories for the affected Cub Cadet, Hustler and Big Dog mowers. You should review and follow the advisory
            applicable to you.<b> Cub Cadet Service Advisory CC-1147, Hustler, Service Advisory 39 rev. A. Big Dog Service Advisory 9 rev. A.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Kawasaki and other mower manufacturers are sending out dealer communications and will continue to do so. To avoid confusion and to ensure that the proper actions are
            taken for the affected units sent to your dealership, you must follow the advisories that come from the SBD Service Department and ignore any other advisory. This is
            very important for the safety of your customers.
        </p>

        <p>We are working with Kawasaki on a resolution and will communicate updates when available.</p>

        <p>
            We are sending all registered consumers a Stop Use letter which will be mailed out shortly and we will be asking dealers to send in dealer inventory transfers or
            registrations for any customers that havenâ€™t been registered yet.
        </p>
